# sparse_Bayes_phase_retrieval
code for paper: "Optimal sparse phase retrieval via a quasi-Bayesian approach"

Note that one needs to get the codes from the paper: Wu, F. and Rebeschini, P. (2023). Nearly minimax-optimal rates for noisy sparse phase retrieval via
 early-stopped mirror descent. Information and Inference: A Journal of the IMA, 12(2):633â€“713.
as we will compare with that methods.
